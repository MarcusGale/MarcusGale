💫 About Me:

I'm a Software Engineer and recent Computer Science graduate focused on building high-performance, full-stack AI/ML applications. I specialize in turning complex data into measurable business impact.

🔭 I’m currently working on:

Engineering an AI Prompt Router to optimize LLM selection for cost and latency.

Mastering the NeetCode 150 to sharpen my algorithmic intuition for high-scale systems.

🚀 I’m looking to collaborate on:

Scalable AI/ML infrastructure projects.

Innovative Full-Stack solutions that leverage real-time data and LLMs.

⚡ Recent Wins:

Developed a production-ready AI Voice Agent for Aven (FinTech) using Vapi and Gemini LLM.

Achieved a 30% reduction in token costs through custom middleware and prompt routing.

🧠 I’m currently learning:

Deep-level system design and advanced cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP).

Optimizing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines for low-latency responses.

💬 Ask me about:

How I reduced P95 latency from 4.2s to 2.6s in my AI systems.

My obsession with Java DSA and building custom data structures from scratch.

🎮 Fun fact:
My introduction to coding began at age 12 when I modded NBA 2K13 roster files on the Xbox 360, successfully extracting hidden cyberfaces, player portraits, and classic courts directly from the game disk.
