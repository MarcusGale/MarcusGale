💫 About Me

I am a Software Engineer and recent Computer Science graduate focused on building scalable, full-stack AI/ML solutions. I bridge the gap between rigorous algorithmic foundations and real-world business impact.

🚀 Currently working on: Refining high-performance AI systems, including an AI Prompt Router that optimized LLM latency by 40% and a production-grade AI Voice Agent for the FinTech sector.

🧠 Sharpening my craft: Diligently completing the NeetCode 150 and the Pareto LeetCode set to master complex data structures and system efficiency.

🤝 Looking to collaborate on: Open-source AI infrastructure, RAG-powered applications, and high-scale backend systems.

📚 Currently learning: Advanced TypeScript and Next.js to complement my deep roots in Java and C++. I'm also exploring low-latency vector database integrations with Pinecone.

💬 Ask me about: Building "intelligent" middleware, prompt engineering for business automation, or my journey from a Headstarter Fellow to a full-stack engineer.

⚡ Fun fact: My introduction to coding began at age 12 when I modded NBA 2K13 roster files on the Xbox 360, successfully extracting hidden cyberfaces and classic courts directly from the game disk.
