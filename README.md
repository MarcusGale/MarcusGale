# 💫 About Me:

I'm currently working on



Engineering high-performance AI systems, including a Full-Stack AI Prompt Router that optimizes LLM latency and a production-grade AI Voice Agent for FinTech operations.





I'm looking to collaborate on



Impactful software engineering projects, especially those leveraging AI/ML and RAG architecture, that push boundaries and solve complex infrastructure challenges. I'm eager to contribute to cutting-edge, scalable solutions.





I'm looking for help with



Deepening my expertise in TypeScript and Next.js to build even more robust full-stack applications. I am also actively seeking mentorship to refine my approach to system design and large-scale backend architecture.





I'm currently learning



Advanced data structures through the NeetCode 150 and exploring the integration of vector databases like Pinecone and modern LLM orchestration for autonomous agents.





Ask me about



My journey from a Headstarter Fellow to building intelligent middleware, and how I use my foundational Java/C++ skills to engineer high-leverage outcomes in the AI space.





Fun fact



My introduction to coding began at age 12 when I modded NBA 2K13 roster files on the Xbox 360, successfully extracting hidden cyberfaces, player portraits, jerseys, and classic NBA courts directly from the game disk.
